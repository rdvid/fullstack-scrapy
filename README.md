simple as it.


### Running locally

will need:
- Backend:
  - Docker
  - Docker-compose
  - Wsl2
- Frontend:
  - Live-server extension (VSCode) 

### Running Locally



### Development 
In development environment you'll need more than just Docker


## ⚙️ Next Features

The development process starts but never ends. Next features will be focused on:

- [ ] Implement other data sources aside of Amazon (i.e: Olx, Kabum, Submarino)
- [ ] Login system and Dashboard for data analisys
- [ ] Maybe a email sender for PDF report generation with Aws lambda for cloud study purposes (?)
- [ ] More pattern improvement, exploring themes like Queue and Load Balancing for heavy stress contexts
